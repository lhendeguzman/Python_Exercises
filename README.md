This program lists the words used in a song and counts how many times it occurs. In here, I used "Baby" by Justin Bieber. I just find it funny to use a repetitive song to build a song lyrics counter. I cleaned up the lyrics a little bit by removings the capitalization, parentheses and apostrophes to avoid syntax confusion.
